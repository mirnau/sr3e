This started as a side project to run my own Shadowrun 3rd Edition campaign. Over time it grew bigger than I first planned, and it felt like a shame not to share.
SR3E is an experiment in using Foundry as more than digital paper—reactive sheets, flexible theming, and a space that feels alive with neon and grime.
Right now it’s just me tinkering, but maybe others will find it useful, or even want to join in.
It’s rough, it’s in progress.d
